# Reinforcement Learning - Multi-armed bandits

The goal of this lab is to implement and test various algorithms to solve the problem of k-handed bandits. For the sake of simplicity, we will focus on its very simple variant: predicting which of the songs may become a future hit (so it is worth playing it to other users). Prize 1 means the listener who listened to it in its entirety, prize 0 means that the song was skipped. As part of this work, 5 algorithms will be implemented: **Explore-Then-Commit, Greedy, UCB, Gradient, Thompson**.
